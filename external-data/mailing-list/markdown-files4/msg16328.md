Hi Sevilha! Welcome - I'm excited to hear about your first experience with 
Riak. If you're comfortable with Vagrant, you have a few options here: 
https://github.com/basho-labs/vagrant-riak-meta

If you'd prefer to test in AWS, you can search the store for Riak and find a 
2.1.1 release there. 

Either of those options are a good start.

&gt; Hello everybody,
&gt; I'm very new at Riak and I intend to really use it for the next months. But, 
&gt; I'd like to create a environment first at my notebook to try it. I'll develop 
&gt; a python program and want to test Riak.
&gt; Which is the best way to do so? Create one ou two VM at my windows OS or 
&gt; there is another way to create this development and test environment?
&gt; 
&gt; thx,
&gt;
