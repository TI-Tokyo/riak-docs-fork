Indeed. contrib.basho.com doesn't have any Search-specific functions
at the moment, but we definitely want to add some if people have
anything to share. I'm sure a pre-commit hook that checks the
content-type of to-be-indexed data would be hugely useful to a lot of
users.

&gt; Thanks for the tip Eric,
&gt; I implemented my own precommit hook that checks the content-type of the
&gt; object being stored.  If it is application/json then it calls the precommit
&gt; function defined by the search module.  If not, it just returns the object.
&gt; Seems to work fine!

&gt; This might not be the correct answer but you could write your own version if
&gt; the search post\_commit hook.
