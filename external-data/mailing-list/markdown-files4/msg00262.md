Sean,

I apologize if this is readily available in the docs, faq, etc. (I
obviously missed if it is).

When a cluster is repartitioned, e.g. as a result of adding or
removing vnodes, is one backend preferable to another? Does keeping
node size down help/hurt in terms of performance, reliability, etc?

&gt; It looks like you're filling up the dets tables -- which have a 2GB limit per 
&gt; file, although Riak uses multiple files, one per vnode.  Have you tried the 
&gt; innostore backend?  Also if you continue to use dets, try increasing the 
&gt; number of partitions, which will make more, smaller files.
