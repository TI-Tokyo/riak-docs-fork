Fredrik,

Unfortunately, because of limitations in Riak Search 0.14.x, it can only
(pre-)sort reliably on the document ID. However, it seems like OrderNumber
might be a natural ID for this document? If so, you could do something like
the following:

http://riak/solr/order/select?rows=1&presort=key&q=
Order\_Contact\_Email:firstname.lastn...@company.com

However, this query will also return in ascending order. If you just want
the highest order number, then feeding this query to MapReduce and
processing it there would seem appropriate.
