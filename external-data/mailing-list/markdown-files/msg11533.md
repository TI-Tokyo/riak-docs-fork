It's unlikely to be that problem since I don't have any test data in my system 
yet. My "batch functions" are just running in the background doing what they 
normally do (i.e. running a mapreduce as well as querying all keys from a 
specific bucket). However, since there is no actual data yet, I'm surprised I'm 
running into a timeout issue.

Riak 1.4 introduced a time out setting that defaults to 60,000 seconds. If you 
need to read for longer periods of time, you'll need to increase the timeout. 
You can set it on the messages that are being sent in to Riak. 

Is this, perhaps, what you're running into?
