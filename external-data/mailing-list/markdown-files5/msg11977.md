Hi Ryan,

sorry for the late reply. We are running 1.3.2 and after deleting the buffer.\\* 
files, riak started. However, running the riak\\_search\\_vnode:repair( P ) 
resulted in plenty of errors like:

As our Riak Search app isn't yet critical, I decided to do a rolling restart 
with rm -rf /storage/riak/merge\\_index/\\* on each node. The KV (leveldb) + MR 
functionality was working and new keys were properly indexed by Riak search. 
All I had to do was rewrite old keys in Riak search in order to reindex them. 
So everything is working now.

I am now performing a migration to Riak 1.4.1. My initial idea was to use 
yokozuna but I noticed that it's bundled for 1.4.0 only and I'd rather have the 
fixes that come with 1.4.1. So I guess that we'll have to wait a bit more for 
it.

Thanks for the help!

regards,
Deyan

&gt; Deyan,

&gt; What Riak version are you running? There was a corruption issue discovered 
&gt; and fixed in the 1.4.0 release.
&gt; 
&gt; https://github.com/basho/riak/blob/riak-1.4.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md#issues--prs-resolved
&gt; https://github.com/basho/merge\\_index/pull/30
&gt; 
&gt; As for fixing, you'll want to delete the buffer files for the partitions 
&gt; which are having issues. E.g. if you look in crash.log you'll see partition 
&gt; numbers for the crashing vnodes.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; \\*\\* Data == 
&gt; &gt; {state,685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520,riak\\_search\\_vnode,undefined,undefined,none,undefined,undefined,undefined,undefined,0}
&gt; 
&gt; In the 
&gt; /storage/riak/merge\\_index/685078892498860742907977265335757665463718379520 
&gt; you'll see buffer files. You'll want to delete those. After deleting all 
&gt; these bad buffers Riak Search should start fine. You'll then want to upgrade 
&gt; to 1.4.1 to avoid corruption in the future. Finally, since you have to 
&gt; delete the buffers you'll have missing indexes and you'll want to re-index 
&gt; your data.
&gt; 
&gt; Since only one of your nodes experience corruption you can use the built-in 
&gt; repair functionality to re-index only data for those partitions. First 
&gt; you'll want to attach to one of your nodes. Then for each partition run the 
&gt; following.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; riak\\_search\\_vnode:repair(P)
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure to run repair for only one partition at a time to avoid overloading 
&gt; anything.
&gt; 
&gt; To determine when a repair is finished you can periodically call the 
&gt; following. Once it returns 'no\\_repair' that indicates it has finished.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; riak\\_search\\_vnode:repair\\_status(P)
&gt; 
&gt; Here is more information on the repair command.

&gt; hi,

&gt; we have a 3 node cluster and one of the node crashed yesterday.
&gt; Nodes are db1, db2 and db3. We started other services on db1 and db2 and db1 
&gt; crashed. Currently db2 and db3 are fine, balanced, receiving writes and 
&gt; serving reads.
&gt; However, db1 has issues starting. When I start the node, it outputs numerous 
&gt; errors and this finally results in a core dump. We use Riak search and this 
&gt; may be the reason for the dump. After starting the node, these are the first 
&gt; errors that are seen in the log file:

&gt; Attached is an archive of the /var/log/riak directory. The logs there are for 
&gt; the latest starting attempt. Riak core dumped in a minute or two after being 
&gt; started.
&gt; Is there a way to fix the merge index corruption and start the node?
&gt; 
&gt; thank you for your efforts,
