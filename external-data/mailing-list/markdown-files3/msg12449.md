Could you do it? Sure.

Should you do it? No.

An advantage of Riak is that you can avoid the cost of SAN storage by
getting duplication at the machine level rather than rely on your storage
vendor to provide it.

Running Riak on a SAN also exposes you to the SAN becoming your bottleneck;
you only have so many fiber/iSCSI ports and a fixed number of disks. The
risk of storage contention is high, too, so you can run into latency issues
that are difficult to diagnose without looking into both Riak as well as
the storage system.

Keeping cost in mind, too, SAN storage is about 10x the cost of consumer
grade SSDs. Not to mention feature licensing and support... The cost
comparison isn't favorable.

Please note: Even though your vendor calls it a SAN, that doesn't mean it's
a SAN.
