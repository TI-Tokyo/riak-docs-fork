Cluade,

The example code in the readme on github does have some basic examples of using 
MR in the Java client: https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client - scroll down 
to about 3/4 of the way to the end. 

I'm also currently working on a more comprehensive Java client "cookbook" and 
MR is probably the next item I'll be adding. 

Is there a particular thing you're trying to do that you need help with?

Thanks,
Brian Roach
