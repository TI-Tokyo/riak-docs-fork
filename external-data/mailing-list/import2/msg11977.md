Hi Ryan,

sorry for the late reply. We are running 1.3.2 and after deleting the buffer.\* 
files, riak started. However, running the riak\_search\_vnode:repair( P ) 
resulted in plenty of errors like:
[因
2013-08-08 16:36:08.261 [error] <0.1938.0> Supervisor mi\_buffer\_converter\_sup 
had child ignored started with mi\_buffer\_converter:start\_link(<0.8157.0>,

 in context child\_terminated
[因

As our Riak Search app isn't yet critical, I decided to do a rolling restart 
with rm -rf /storage/riak/merge\_index/\* on each node. The KV (leveldb) + MR 
functionality was working and new keys were properly indexed by Riak search. 
All I had to do was rewrite old keys in Riak search in order to reindex them. 
So everything is working now.

I am now performing a migration to Riak 1.4.1. My initial idea was to use 
yokozuna but I noticed that it's bundled for 1.4.0 only and I'd rather have the 
fixes that come with 1.4.1. So I guess that we'll have to wait a bit more for 
it.

Thanks for the help!

regards,
Deyan
