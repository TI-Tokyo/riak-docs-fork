Hi Vicky,

Sorry for the late response here.

Bad news, good news, and better news ..

Bad - looks like you're hitting this issue bug -
https://issues.basho.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1250
Good - it was fixed in 1.0.1 [a] (and perhaps you've already upgraded)
Better - 1.0.2 will be out \*very\* soon (we are in the final testing
stages). You're probably best to hold tight for a bit and upgrade from
1.0.0 -> 1.0.2

Mark
