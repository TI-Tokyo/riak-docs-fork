Thanks Sargun,


1. Keys do get exposed to client. We recently learnt about this limitation
of javascript and we will convert the keys to String when they get to
javascript.
2. Considering Bitcask as storage choice due to its performance, but we
are open for levelDB as well. BTW, We already have tenantId (UUID) in the
bucket name.
3. Coming from RDBMS background, we are used to seeing incremental Ids.
K-sort is not a hard requirement but nice to have.
