Shane,

Several points for your consideration:

- "cache\_size" is broken in 1.3.x, fixed in 1.4.x. Any cache\_size above the 
default 8M can ruin performance because some idiot (me) put a linear walk in 
the cache code. Reverted for 1.4 and cache\_size tested to 2G.

- do you have AAE (active anti-entropy) running? AAE creates a parallel set of 
vnodes/databases to track hash trees of the primary vnodes. This will add to 
your memory load.

- max\_open\_files in 1.3 puts a limit on the count of open files, but NOT on the 
amount of memory that is used by each file. The larger .sst files create 
larger bloom filters which take up a greater amount of memory for same 
max\_open\_files setting. Poor accounting. 1.4.x has a correction that changes 
file cache accounting from file count to amount of memory used per file (limit 
is 4Mbyte \* max\_open\_files). I am aware of one other 1.3.x site that had to 
reduce their max\_open\_files from 300 or more, to around 70 to stabilize memory.

That said, I have attached a spreadsheet that simplifies the math discussed on 
our web site. I have plugged in your numbers and see a "balance" around 
cache\_size=8388603 and max\_open\_files=200. 


I am currently writing a dynamic cache size model for Riak 2.0. All the smoke 
and mirrors for memory sizing will then go away. The code will automatically 
change caches as vnodes migrate to and from a given node (no need to "reserve 
50%") … you just say total memory you want to allocate to Riak and walk away.
